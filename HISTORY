        the title, start and end time of the broadcast event its description, synopsis and genre(s) if 
        these informations are available as SI data in the transport stream.

        When rendering such an item by an UPnP client a small confirmation video is given, too.

        of the associated broadcast event.
 - New: Audio broadcast streaming and recording

        - to show the radio containers and items
        - to prepend a broadcast title by the channel name
        - to append the channel name to the recording title
        - to show/hide EPG containers and items with the content directory browse function

        When using the upnp plugin with this ffmpeg version the 'DEFINES' parameter of
        the Makefile has to be appended with 'AVCODEC53' to reflect changed header files.
 - Database accesses are made with precompiled SQL statements allowing faster responses. 
   New database tables have been created to reflect EPG items, record timer items and audio broadcast.
 - Recording lengths and durations are checked and updated periodically.
