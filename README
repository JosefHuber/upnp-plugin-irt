Description:

UPnP/DLNA Plugin for Video Disk Recorder

This Plugins extends the VDR with the possibility to act as an UPnP/DLNA Media
Server (DMS). It will serve VDR's contents in the network to any UPnP-AV and
DLNA capable devices.

The plugin requires a valid network connection with a IPv4 address. It will find
its settings automatically by default. In this case, the first network device in
the network device list with a valid IPv4 address and port 49152 will be used
for connections. You can change this behavior either by setting the command line
options or by editing the setup via the VDRs setup page. The command line
options have a higher priority and substitute the menu settings.

The command line settings are:
  -i <interface>  --int=<interface>     The server network
                                        interface
                                        e.g: eth0, wlan1 etc.
                                        If given option '-a' must
                                        be absent.
  -a <address>    --address=<address>   The server IPv4 address.
                                        If given option '-i' must
                                        be absent.
  -p <port>       --port=<port>         The server port
                                        Supported ports:
                                        0           (auto detect)
                                        49152-65535 (user defined)
  -d              --autodetect          Force auto detection
                                        Use this option to
                                        overwrite the setup menu
                                        options.
  -v              --verbose             Increase verbosity level
                                        The more v options the
                                        higher the output level
                  --dbdir=<directory>   The directory in which the
                                        metadata database is stored
                  --httpdir=<directory> The directory where the
                                        http documents are located
  -B		  --broadcastprepend	Prepend the broadcast event title with
  					the channel number and channel name.
  -C		  --changeradioclass	Change the UPnP Class "object.item.audioitem.audioBroadcast"
  					to "object.item.videoItem.videoBroadcast".
  -D              --duration            Change a resource duration of '0:00:00'
  					to '0:50:00'.
  -E <file>       --epg=<file>          Prepare EPG containers and items and
  					show them with contentdirectory::browse.
  					The 'file' specifies the epg data file in use.
  -F <amount>     --first_channels      Take only the first n channels
                                        from channels.conf. Default: Show all.					
  -O              --oppress_timers      When the parameter is given, with the
  					contentdirectory::browse the folders with
  					the record timers are oppressed.
  -P <days>       --preview_epg         The number of days the EPG events are
  					gathered in advance. The -P parameter
  					only takes effect when combined with -E.
  					Default value: 7 days.
  -R              --radio               Prepare radio containers and items and
  					show them with contentdirectory::browse.
  -T		  --title_append	Append the channel name to the recording title.					
  -W		  --without_ca   	Only free to air channels are selected
  					from channels.conf.					

The verbose option can be more than once. With each option the verbosity level
will be increased. The maximum level is 5. Further options are silently ignored.

  -v                                  Print most important messages
  -vv                                 Print messages from the components
                                      i.e. the webserver, CDS, CMS, etc.
  -vvv                                Print messages from receivers and players
                                      and other additional components
  -vvvv                               You can't get enough, hum?
                                      This will print SQL messages and DIDL
                                      messages
  -vvvvv                              Can you read the matrix? You can't?
                                      Then try first reading SQL statements,
                                      fetches, buffer and parser outputs or
                                      any other outputs.

If not options are set, menu options will be used.

The server has a unique identifier, which is
"uuid:b120ba52-d88d-4500-9b64-888971d83fd3". Other devices in the network can
find and identify the VDR UPnP Server with this ID. However, the server should
be found automatically and being listed under the supported media server
devices. If not, please report this as a bug on the project homepage or send an
email to the developers of this plugin with the full device description and, if
applicable, the errors thrown by the media player device and/or the server.


Dependencies:

This plugin is tested with and requires the following libraries to work:

libupnp-1.6.6               The UPnP SDK
libsqlite-3.6               SQLite 3 Database

libavcodec-svn20090303 or libavcodec53 (6:0.8.5-1)  FFMPEG Library for analyzing
                                                    audio video codecs
libavformat-svn20090303 or libavformat53(6:0.8.5-1) FFMPEG Library for analyzing 
                                                    audio video formats
boost::spirit               Grammar parser
boost::function             Boost function library
boost::bind                 Boost bind library

The boost libraries are usually available in a packed version, so that only a
single installation is required. The FFMPEG libraries comes with FFMPEG itself.

ATTENTION: DO NOT USE ANOTHER VERSION OF LIBUPNP.

libupnp-1.8.0 is known not to work with this plugin! Versions below 1.6.6 may
work. However, there may exist some unknown issues.

If you want to know everything about the code, please see the source code
documentation at http://upnp.vdr-developer.org/docs/ where all public members
are explained.

I appreciate, if you help making the plugin better. If you find any project
related errors or missing features, please open a new ticket at the plugin
website with a detailed description of what you want or what happened.


Patching the libupnp:

If you have a DLNA compliant device such as TVs or streaming clients, you may
require a patched version of libupnp. You can download the patch on the project
website.

Required plugin configuration folders and files:

For an adequate operation there have to be the three folders 'http', 
'EpgProgrammingConfirmation' and 'RecTimerPurgeConfirmation' within the upnp plugin's 
configuration path (just copy the folders from 'configDir' to their new destination):
- 'http' with subfolders 'icons' and 'xml'.
  The xml folder contains the content directory and connection manager service SCPD files.
- 'EpgProgrammingConfirmation' with the file '00001.ts' (This small video is used
   to confirm a scheduled recording task.)
- 'RecTimerPurgeConfirmation' with the file '00001.ts' (This small video is used
   to confirm the deletion of a recording task.)
